Question: How can we forecast local foster care influxes so that state governments can allocate and prepare?

1.Why we chose this project
2. Our goal: advise state government on foster funding allocation in the local level (counties)
3. Definitions and key performance indicators
3. Examine variables that contribute to the entrance of children into the foster system
Regional representation
-Region Relationships: income, education, ethnicity, religion
4. Examine variables that contribute to the exit of children from the foster system
Regional representation
--Region Relationships: income, education, ethnicity, religion
5. Discuss correlations and make recommendation to state’s allocation strategy



























Project Description 

Foster Care identifies and places children in safe homes when they cannot remain with their families because of safety concerns. Foster families provide these children with the consistency and support they need to grow. The ultimate goal is to place the child in a permanent home that will be safe a and  provide a sense of stability. 

Our project is to uncover entrance and permanency patterns in foster care within the state of Florida . We'll examine relationships between income, education level, and other demographic factors to identify a correlation between areas with high instances of permanency  versus areas with lower instances within our state. The goal being to creative a model that can be used to forecast foster problems and assist state government in financial allocation decisions

Permanency: is the discharge of a child from out-of-home care to a permanent home, indicating reunification, adoption, or permanent guardianship. Specific permanency discharge reasons include: Adoption, Guardianship, Guardianship to Non-Relative, Guardianship to Relative, Living with Other Relatives, Reunification with Parent(s)/Primary Caretaker.(Source:Florida Department of Children and Families-Office of Child Welfare:Child Welfare Dashboard Documentation)


Out-of-Home Care: is substitute care provided for children placed away from their parents or guardians regardless of placement type or custodian, including those in licensed foster care, kinship (relative or non relative) care, or any other placement where the State agency has placement and care responsibility. This status is defined by the entry of a removal episode in FSFN.

Research Questions:

How can we forecast local foster care influxes so that state governments can allocate and prepare a solution?


Data Sources/Methodology:

Out-of-Home Care is substitute care provided for children placed away from their parents or guardians regardless of placement type or custodian, including those in licensed foster care, kinship (relative or non-relative) care, or any other placement where the State agency has placement and care responsibility. This status is defined by the entry of a removal episode in FSFN.

Percent of Children Exiting Out-of-Home Care to a Permanent Home within 12 Months of Entering Care

Report Description: This measure is the percentage of children who entered out-of-home care during the report period where the child achieved permanency within twelve (12) months of entering out-of-home care. This measure is similar to the federal indicator, Permanency in 12 Months for Children Entering Foster Care. 
Report Frequency: Quarterly Report Period: The twelve (12) month period ending twelve (12) months prior to the end of the report quarter (e.g., July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016 for the report quarter ending June 30, 2017). 
Denominator: The number of children who entered out-of-home care during the report period. Numerator: The subset of children in the denominator where the child achieved permanency within twelve (12) months of their removal date.

Percent of Children Exiting Out-of-Home Care to a Permanent Home in 12 Months for 
Children in Out-of-Home Care 12-23 Months

Report Description: This measure is the percentage of children in out-of-home care as of the beginning of the report period whose length of stay is between twelve (12) and twenty-three (23) months as of the beginning of the report period who achieved permanency within twelve (12) months of the beginning of the report period. This measure is similar to the federal indicator, Permanency in 12 Months for Children in Foster Care 12 – 23 Months. 
Report Frequency: Quarterly Report Period: The beginning of the day twelve (12) months prior to the end of the report quarter (e.g., January 1, 2017 for the report quarter ending December 31, 2017). 
Denominator: The number of children in out-of-home care between twelve (12) and twenty-three (23) months as of the beginning of the report period. 
Numerator: The subset of children in the denominator where the child achieved permanency within 12 months of the report period

Percent of Children Exiting Out-of-Home Care to a Permanent Home in 12 Months for Children in Out-of-Home Care 24+ Months
 
Report Description: This measure is the percentage of children in out-of-home care as of the beginning of the report period whose length of stay is twenty-four (24) months or longer as of the beginning of the report period who achieved permanency within twelve (12) months of the beginning of the report period. This measure is similar to the federal indicator, Permanency in 12 Months for Children in Foster Care 24 Months or Longer. Report Frequency: Quarterly Report Period: The beginning of the day twelve (12) months prior to the end of the report quarter (e.g., January 1, 2017 for the report quarter ending December 31, 2017).  
Denominator: The number of children in out-of-home care twenty-four (24) months or longer as of the beginning of the report period. 
Numerator: The subset of children in the denominator where the child achieved permanency within 12 months of the report period.

Percent of Children who Do Not Re-enter Out-of-Home Care within 12 Months of Moving to a Permanent Home
 
Report Description: This measure is the percentage of exits from out-of-home care to permanency for a cohort of children who entered out-of-home care during the report period and exited within twelve (12) months of entering and subsequently do not re-enter out-of-home care within twelve (12) months of their permanency date. This measure is similar to the federal indicator, Re-Entry to Foster Care.
Report Frequency: Quarterly Report Period: The twelve (12) month period ending twenty-four (24) months prior to the end of the report quarter. (e.g., October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016 for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2018). 
Denominator: The number of children who entered out-of-home care during the report period and achieved permanency within twelve (12) months of their removal date. 
Numerator: The subset of children in the denominator where the child did not re-enter out-of-home care within twelve (12) months of their permanency date. 

Placement Moves per 1,000 Days in Out-of-Home Care

Report Description: This measure is the rate at which children change placements while in out-of-home care during the report period. This measure is similar to the federal indicator, Placement Stability. 
Report Frequency: Quarterly Report Period: The twelve (12) month period ending at the end of the report quarter (e.g., October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 for the 12-month period ending September 30, 2017).
Denominator: The total number of days in out-of-home care during the report period for children entering out of-home care during the report period. 
Numerator: The total number of placement moves during the report period for all children in the denominator. 


Annual Rate of Adoptions Achieved
 
Report Description: This measure is the number of children in out-of-home care who were legally free for adoption who were adopted within twelve (12) months of the beginning of the report period. 
Report Frequency: Quarterly Report Period: The beginning of the day twelve (12) months prior to the end of the report quarter (e.g., January 1, 2017 for the report quarter ending December 31, 2017). 
Denominator: The number of children in out-of-home care for whom both parents have had their parental rights terminated or are deceased as of the report period begin date. 
Numerator: The subset of children in the denominator who were adopted within 12 months of the report period begin date
